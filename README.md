### Decision Tree

This is an implementation of the _Classification and Regression Tree_ a.k.a _CART algorithm_ 
for decision trees.

It uses _Gini Index_ as a measure to decide the optimal split for the data while building the decision tree.

This work is to be used as a reference to understand the coded implementation of the CART algorithm
and the use of Decision Trees for classification.

### Usage:

You will find a guide on how to use this decision tree for classification in this repo.
